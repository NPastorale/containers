### Hello there!

I'm Nahuel, a Platform Engineer with a passion for all things tech.

### What I Do:

By day, I'm knee-deep in a plethora of technologies. Whenever I'm lucky those include Kubernetes, containers in some shape or form and not Windows. Otherwise I might find myself provisioning GitLab instances, optimising pipelines or teaching people how to be more efficient/secure in their work, among other things. I love the challenge of solving complex problems and shaving off precious seconds from a build step. There is nothing like the warmth of a developer's smile when they see their node_modules being fetched from cache for the first time.

By night, I basically do the same, but I don't get paid for it... it is definitely not a good deal.

### Who I Am:

Beyond the screen, I'm just a regular everyday normal _person_ who enjoys electronics, motorcycling and falling off from my electric skateboard. I strive for finding a balance between the digital and analog worlds, although that does not happen as much as it should.

### Join Me:

Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast or just curious about mostly ordinary, but sometimes very niche situations and my approach to them, I invite you to explore with me.
